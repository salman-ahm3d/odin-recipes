    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        You've officially run out of reasons to say you can't bake a cake.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
        <li>1 ¾ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>¾ cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons baking soda</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>½ cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 cup boiling water</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li> Grease and flour two nine-inch round pans. OR line a half sheet pan with parchment paper and spray with cooking spray if you want to bake a sheet cake.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, stir together the sugar, flour, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.</li>
        <li>Add the eggs, milk, oil, and vanilla.</li>
        <li>Mix for 2 minutes on medium speed of mixer. Stir in the boiling water last.</li>
        <li>The batter will be thin. Pour evenly into the prepared pans.</li>
        <li>Bake 30 to 35 minutes in the preheated oven until you can insert a toothpick into the cake, and remove it dry. <strong><em>OR</em></strong> if you're baking a sheet cake, bake for only 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Cool in the pan(s) for 10 minutes, then remove to a wire rack to cool completely.
        </li>
    </ol>
